Description: The manchester_england.osm file contains the OpenStreetMap data of the Greater Manchester area.
Reason of choice: I chose this area because the osm file has the appropriate file size (~300MB) and I am living in UK so that I am more familiar with basic info of the dataset and can sense check the results.
